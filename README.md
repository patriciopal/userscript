#*Userscripts.org is dead; long live userscripts.org.*
This is the massive undertaking of categorizing and sorting the scripts from the now-defunkt userscripts.org.

##TODO
+ ~~Remove empty files~~
+ ~~Remove files with only comments (spam)~~
+ Rename files to numerically sequential filenames (this will break dependencies on some scripts, I know, I consider this collateral damage.)
+ Sort files into directories of one-thousand files (this is so Github will show the all the files in Github.com, other than that it’s arbitrary and not reflective of how the scripts will be sorted in the future)
+ Conceptualize a community-curated (think reddit.com) site to house these (Django)
