#*Userscripts.org is dead; long live userscripts.org.*
This is the massive undertaking of categorizing and sorting the scripts from the now-defunkt userscripts.org.

##TODO
+ ~~Remove empty files~~
+ ~~Remove files with only comments (spam)~~
+ ~~Rename files to numerically sequential filenames (this will break dependencies on some scripts, I know, I consider this collateral damage.)~~ (Not actually doing this now, scripts will keep original filenames.)
+ ~~Sort files into directories of one-thousand files (this is so Github will show the all the files in Github.com, other than that itâ€™s arbitrary and not reflective of how the scripts will be sorted in the future)~~
+ Put together a method of sorting, scoring, and linting scripts for curation.
